# Ansible

Imagine a tool able to automate any repeating task for a system administrator. Ansible allows you to coordinate tasks on your servers. Instead of having to ssh onto your server and do a task, you can run a playbook instead. Playbooks run on sets of hosts performing a task. Written as a yml document, it is human-readable and can be checked into source control.
