Imagine a tool capable of automating any repetitive task for a system administrator. Ansible allows you to coordinate tasks on your servers. Instead of having to SSH onto your server and perform a task, you can run a playbook instead. Playbooks run on sets of hosts, performing a task. Written as a YAML document, it is human-readable and can be checked into source control.
