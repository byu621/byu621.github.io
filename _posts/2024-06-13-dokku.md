# Dokku

Dokku is open-source PAAS software on GitHub. Eases the deployment of applications to a server. It does this by opioniating every step of the process.

- Get the source code onto the server
- Create a database
- Set the DATABASE_URL
- Build your application
- Run the application
- Expose the application

In Dokku land

- Use custom dokku git remote to push the source code onto the server
- Dokku supports every popular OSS database provider e.g. MySql, Postgres. Create the database of your choice by installing the plugin, and running `dokku postgres:create`
- Link the database with your application by running `dokku postgres:link`
- Build and Run of your application is done automatically by scanning the source code. No configuration is required
- Dokku also supports application lifetime, exposing the application through http, creating SSL certificates
